# EcoRide-connect
 A project using html, external css ,javascript that contributes to making our country eco-friendly. Currently, many of us commute to college alone in separate vehicles, increasing both traffic and pollution. Often, students traveling to the same destination use individual vehicles, unknowingly adding to road congestion. To address this, the app would allow students traveling solo to register and find a partner, sharing rides to college. This solution would reduce the number of vehicles on the road, easing traffic and supporting a greener, more sustainable environment.
